This is a Jenkins pipeline script designed to build and deploy Android apps using Gradle and 
Fabric (now known as Firebase Crashlytics). 

-> checkout scm fetches the code from the repository.
-> sh 'git submodule update --init' updates any submodules in the repository.
[
    Git submodules are a way to include another Git repository as a subdirectory within your main repository. 
    This is commonly used when you want to include an external library or a shared component in your project, 
    while still keeping them separate as individual repositories.

    When you initialize or clone a repository with submodules, the submodules' content is not automatically downloaded along
    with the main repository. Instead, you get references to specific commits in the submodules.

    The command git submodule update --init is used to initialize and update these submodules in your repository, 
    making sure you have the latest content of the submodules checked out at the correct commit.

    For example, let's say your Android project uses a third-party library that is included as a Git submodule. 
    If you don't run the git submodule update --init command during the checkout stage, you might end up with an outdated or 
    incorrect version of the submodule, which could lead to unexpected issues or bugs in your build.

-> echo "My branch is: ${env.BRANCH_NAME}" prints the current branch name.
-> The flavor variable is then defined by calling the flavor function with the env.BRANCH_NAME as an argument.
-> The flavor function extracts the Android flavor from the branch name.
-> It uses a regular expression to match the pattern /QA_([a-z_]+)/ in the branch name and extracts the captured flavor name.
